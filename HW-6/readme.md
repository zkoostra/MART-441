#HW 5

OMG I turned in an assignment on time. AM I OK??? The answer is yes, I am great.

So, this assignment was pretty easy for me. The comments you put in the examples and the way you went through the steps was SO HELPFUL and it reminded me that that was how I used to code in 120 (Making a list of what I need to do and then writing the code that does it.) It is super helpful and next time I'm going to try doing that on my own before I watch the hw breakdown video, since like, you won't be able to make breakdown videos for me for the rest of forever.

Anyways, I did have some trouble with the "table" which it isn't really, it's divs BUT I kind of hate tables and making tables out of divs and trying to make changes to the style sheet so it looks how I want. I tried to mess with it and make it how I wanted but I just made it really kooky looking so I reverted to what was in the example. One of my biggest stuggles with web design is translating like what numbers and tags tell me in the code into what I want it to look like and vice versa.
I wish there was an app or something where I could design something the way I want it to look like I'm in indesign or illustrator and then the app would give me the code inputs I need to make it look like that online. Is there a thing like that or a way I could do it or do I have to just get better at that the old fashioned way?

I chose the Star Wars prequels for my matching game theme because the other night I dreamed that I was in a Kaimin story pitch meeting with Darth Maul and I've been feeling prequels-y since then. (No I do not remember the story he wanted to write.)

I'm feeling good about arrays. I think I skipped the arrays assignment in CC and for the rest of that class I was always really worried when we had to use them but going over them again in full has made things a lot clearer.

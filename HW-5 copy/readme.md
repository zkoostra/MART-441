#HW 6

Okay here we go. I know this is super late. No excuses, I'm sorry.

This assignment wasn't that difficult I just waited til the last minute to do it. I liked that we got some help and then had to figure out the rest on our own.

I'm frustrated because the things that aren't working for me are basic things that shouldn't be a problem, like right now, my pages don't link up even though that's a really easy thing to do and I'm not sure why.

I'm really proud of the way I solved the number of trys counter problem and the way that I decided to let the game know it needed to switch pages. And it was so simple it was literally addition, I feel like I'm becoming an efficient thinker.

I need to start coming to the zoom chats. I can never come to the ones on Monday because that's the day I make the newspaper, but I literally don't have anything going on Wednesdays, I just forget.

Anyways, this isn't 100% complete but I think I have the parts you're looking for figured out.

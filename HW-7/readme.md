# Homework 7 readme

Here we are orienting our programming around objects! Last year, I was doing MART 120 at the same time as like CS100 or something similar and I did a javascript project in my cs class in oop just to get better at it and whoa boy I wish I hadn't forgotten like every single thing I did last spring!!

I think the idea of OOP is super amazing and once you really start actively thinking in it, it's really helpful and makes things a lot easier. But I had a hard time getting back into the syntax of it and obviously p5 and the projects we did in 120 in general were formatted differently and had really different requirements from the assignment we did this week.

I work at the Kaimin with 2 other girls who are in this class so I wound up consulting them on their techniques for this assignment a little bit but that made it so I felt like I wasn't really coming up with the whole ideas myself, and therefore I don't grasp them quite as well?

I'm turning this in not working totally perfectly. I feel so dumb because my images won't appear even though I've checked my file names and paths like a million times and for some reason that I also can't figure out, my getInfo() function breaks after it runs the first time so you can only see one of the photoLocations. Not a super week for me, but I'm still going along. I'm completing this after the fact and I can say hopefully that the assignments that followed this one seem to be going somewhat better haha.

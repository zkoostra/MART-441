I'm literally the worst, I turn these in so late sometimes and it's not because I'm not working on them which is the really wild thing sometimes they just take me so much time.

I got a lot farther on this one than I originally thought I would and I figured some things out on my own that were pretty tough so I feel really great about that! But I was so peeved at CSS because I had to do so many weird things to make my text and photoLocations show up where I wanted. Also, I never got the box to work. Sorry, I'll fix it and upload again if I figure it out but it's the Monday of spring break and I need to be done with this so for now, it ain't happening.

I think I finally sort of get jquery which like I don't wanna speak too soon or jinx it lol but I understand how the selectors work and I think the order you have to do things when you're using it. The tough part is that the syntax is all new and sometimes it takes a long time to look up the keyword for something you want to do.

Overall, this continues to be really challenging but I'm hoping over break I can catch up where I need to be, start my final project and finish strong for the semester!

# Readme Week 2

Okay, so I know I haven't turned in homework 1, I am very, very sorry. I will turn it in soon. I'm sure ya'll have noticed but some of the instructing in 341 was.. lacking.

That being said, this week was a great refresher on how to use some basic elements of javascript. I took creative coding a whole year ago and I was a little worried I wasn't going to remember enough but I knew what I needed to know and I'm feeling grateful we're doing a slow reintroduction and also learning how to incorportate js into our html files.

Mine is super boring bc I spent most of my homework time this week doing homework for week 1 and I thought bare minimum was okay for now. I would have liked to add a few more things but here we are.

This assignment felt almost too easy? I just did my console.logs and then put the link into an HTML doc. Whoop!

I'm just really excited to learn more about javascript and also maybe get some help on the parts of web design 341 that weren't super clear to me before that stuff hits me like a train.

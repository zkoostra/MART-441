# HW 1

This homework is so late I don't remember a lot of what I did in it. I know that I was completely terrified when we got this assignment because even though I'd just finished web design, I felt like I had very little grasp on CSS or what the assignment was asking me to do.

I got along by filling in my own code in the CSS and experimenting A LOT and then apparently forgetting to turn it in for 8 weeks. Now that I've spent some more time doing CSS I feel a bit better than I did this first week.

I chose the photoLocation, colors and fonts that I did because they're similar to my own real website which I maintain partially using HTML and partially using the hosting site's tools so obviously it's a lot cuter than this.

My face turned out a little big but to be honest I thought it was kind of funny so I chose to leave it.

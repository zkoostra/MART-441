# Read me HW3

Hi, sorry this is late, my computer is not running really well right now and I feel kind of paralyzed because if I don't have it then I can't do any work but if it's not working I also can't do any work? So I've been putting off taking it to get looked at, I'm gonna try and finish this assignment and next week's to give myself some padding and then take it in later today.

I feel like this assignment was really tough because the homework instructions weren't very clear. Like I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the homework was asking and then I was unsure if we were supposed to use specific functions or methods that weren't like talked about in our lesson. I mean this is a 400 level class so I'm fine with that, but I should have emailed or asked more questions because that really slowed me down.

I feel like I'm either thinking this is supposed to be way harder than I'm making it or way easier. I'm anxious to get feedback for this assignment because I don't really know what you want from me.

The actual stuff I did was okay. Functions are an easy callback to 120 but we didn't do a lot of repsonsive stuff in there or at least not til later on and I need to go back and review it because the way I did my response thing is like not very well thought out but at this point I'd rather turn it in and get feedback and keep learning.

Also I used to be able to push my stuff straight from atom but it's not working anymore and if you know what might be going on (the message I get says "unable to find remote helper for https") or if you think it would be worth posting in the forum I will. I just know the class is like "supposed" to push only through github desktop and I can do that but I feel like having two programs to do it when I can do it with one is silly.

Arg.

I'm so frustrated because I feel like can't get the first step (which I honestly think is really simple!!)  and am therefore having trouble getting the rest.

I know a bunch of people were probably lazy assholes who didn't do their homework over spring break but I feel like I could have done this, I just need to talk to like literally anyone who knows what's going on in person.

This was my plan for this assignment:

1. Show the name, station location and gender of all of the humans currently in space. I collected the data, I made it look like something that made sense.
2. Put that data into a table like we saw in the example with the albums.
3. Use a script to highlight the people in space who were women (GIRLS IN STEM WHOO!)
4. Figure out how to add cute little pictures of all the people in space.
5. Find a plugin to make the beginning text look sparkly or spacey in some way.

I couldn't get to step 2. I tried so many variations of the W3 schools code, I tried the simplified version from BEFORE we combined JSON and AJAX and I couldn't make that work either. I went back to like the most basic version of displaying the data, the way we've been learning about for several weeks and that's the one I got to definitively work. I tried working with friends who were in the class to troubleshoot because they were having a hard time as well. I feel really disappointed that I couldn't do more of this assignment on my own and I feel like I really tried.

Also my stylesheet doesn't work I am SPIRALING.
